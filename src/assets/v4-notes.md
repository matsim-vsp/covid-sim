#### School Attendance Scenarios

V4 attempts to replay the development so far, and explores results of various school attendance scenarios and two levels of restrictions on non-school activity:

- On **day 26**, 10% of leisure acts are banned (corresponding to the closure of theaters, etc.)
- On **day 26**, schools / kiga / universities are closed. 10 percent of kiga and primary-aged children still go to kiga / primary schools (Notbetrieb)
- On **day 35**, work, shopping, errands and business are restricted, corresponding to the currently valid "Kontaktsperre":
  - Type A: Work and shopping 60% banned; leisure, business and errands 80% banned
  - Type B: Work and shopping 80% banned; leisure, business and errands 90% banned
- Educational facilities can be reopened on **day 63** (estimated to be the 20th of April) but because of data problems we are particularly unsure of the timeline.

The **base doubling time is approx. 3 days**. It corresponds to the German growth rate 2nd & 3rd week of Mar, i.e. with slight cultural adaptations but not policy interventions.

The **doubling time of "Type A" is approx. 13 days**, which is _more optimistic_ than what we currently measure (approx. 9 days).

"Type B" is even more optimistic.

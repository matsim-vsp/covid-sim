Exploring the effects of several stay-at-home interventions.

The simulations refer to the **Berlin** region (Berlin city plus some surroundings).

The simulations begin on Day 0, with 40 infected individuals in the population. The outcomes below examine consequences of starting various interventions a number of days after the simulation starts.

The **base doubling time is approx. 2.1 days**. It corresponds to the German growth rate end Feb/begin Mar, with neither policy measures nor cultural adaptations.

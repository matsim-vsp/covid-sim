The interventions below depict disease spread following various levels of adherence or compliance with stay-at-home policies.

- Intervention measures go into effect on day 30.

The base doubling time is approx. 2.1 days. I corresponds to a tenfold increase of cases every 7 days, which was the German growth rate end Feb/begin Mar, with neither
policy measures nor cultural adaptations.

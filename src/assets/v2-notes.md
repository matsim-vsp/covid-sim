## v2: Examining adherence rates for stay-at-home orders

The interventions below depict disease spread following various levels of adherence with stay-at-home policies.

- The simulations refer to the **Berlin** region (Berlin city plus some surroundings).
- The simulations begin on Day 0, with 40 infected individuals in the population.
- Intervention measures go into effect on day 30.

The **base doubling time is approx. 2.1 days**. It corresponds to the German growth rate end Feb/begin Mar, with neither policy measures nor cultural adaptations.

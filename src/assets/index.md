## Simulations of COVID-19 spreading in Berlin

Hundreds of scenario combinations are run to produce the following "What if?" estimates of viral propagation under different conditions. 
 
  * "v1" contains the strategies discussed in the paper. 
  * "v3" contains a visual illustration of the method.  
  * All others contain strategies that were in the public discussion after the above paper was made available.  
  * "v5" was used in part to brief the BMBF on Apr/9 about school re-opening options.

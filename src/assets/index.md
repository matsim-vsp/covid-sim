### Simulations of COVID-19 spreading in Berlin

This site collects the results of COVID-19 simulations based on the MATSim agent-based modeling framework.

We use human mobility models, for which we are experts, and attach virus infection dynamics taken from recent literature and publications, This results in a virus spreading dynamics model.

The results should be verified but because of the current time pressure, we publish them in their current state. Recommendations for improvement are welcome.

#### Reopening Options

V5 Notes:

- The simulations refer to the **Berlin** region (Berlin city plus some surroundings).
- Berlin Reported Cases are from [RKI](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0). For many cases, a delay between infection and reporting may occur.
- On **day 26**, 10% of leisure acts are banned (corresponding to the closure of theaters, etc.).
- On **day 26**, schools / kiga / universities are closed. 10 percent of kiga and primary-aged children still go to kiga / primary schools (Notbetrieb).
- On **day 35**, work, shopping, errands and business are restricted, corresponding to the currently valid "Kontaktsperre"; the percentage of work, leisure, shopping, errands and business activities still occuring after **day 35** can be set.
- Educational facilities can be reopened on **day 63** (corresonding to the 20th of April).

[Google COVID-19 Mobility report](google.com/covid19/mobility) shows for Berlin after day 35:

- retail & recreation down by about 70% (i.e. at about **30%**)
- grocery & pharmacy down by about 20% (i.e. at about **80%**)
- parks down by about 20% (i.e. at about **80%**)
- workplace down by about 40% (i.e. at about **60%**)
  Other than google, we do not take the last day, but take visual averages over about a week.

The best approximation to this with our options below would be:

- **leisure** at **20%** (with the assumption that parks do not contribute that much to infections)
- **work** at **60%**
- **shopping** at **40%**
- **errands & business unclear**

If one assumes that the capacity of the Berlin system for critical COVID cases is about 1000, then one finds that there is awfully little room to relax restrictions.

Or alternatively: The currently "blunt" restrictions would need to be replaced by something smarter.

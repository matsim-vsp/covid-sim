V5 Notes:

- On **day 26**, 10% of leisure acts are banned (corresponding to the closure of theaters, etc.)
- On **day 26**, schools / kiga / universities are closed. 10 percent of kiga and primary-aged children still go to kiga / primary schools (Notbetrieb)
- On **day 35**, work, shopping, errands and business are restricted, corresponding to the currently valid "Kontaktsperre":
- The percentage of work, leisure, shopping, errands and business activities still occuring after **day 35** can be set 
- Educational facilities can be reopened on **day 63** (estimated to be the 20th of April) but because of data problems we are particularly unsure of the timeline.

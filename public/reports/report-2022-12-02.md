In this report, we first discuss the potential effects of abolishing the
mask mandate in local and long-distance public transport and a repeal of the isolation requirement.
The model simulations yield a significant change in the maximal hospitalization
incidence by up to a factor of 2 for the most extreme case, in which no infected person goes into isolation anymore; compared to the case, in which
all symptomatically infected persons automatically isolate.
Second, we consider a possible transition from a regime in which
each new viral variant generates a new wave, to a regime in which many genetically closely
related virus variants ("variant soup") occur simultaneously.
In this regime, waves are no longer generated by specific new variants.
Instead, seasonal effects synchronize population immunity. Without seasonal
effects, we would thus be heading for a regime of uniform incidences without waves.
However, the seasonal effects do synchronize population immunity,
so that a winter wave is initially followed by a phase of lower incidences. Because of the, compared to Influenza, 
rapidly declining protection against transmission, our model also shows a lower summer wave in addition to the winter wave for the time being.

Both the simulations and the mobility data show that the behavioural adaptations around March 15 were already more pronounced than previously assumed (Fig. 1):

- We see a steady decline in (non-residential) work and leisure activities already from 8.3.
- Based on current information, it is plausible that infection occurs primarily where people speak, call or sing aloud. For example, in noisy bars/pubs, or spectators and athletes at sporting competitions. It is also plausible to assume that these types of events have been almost completely discontinued, even if leisure activities are still present in the mobility data.

Overall we interpret the situation as follows:

- The measures taken so far have slowed the exponential increase in Berlin long before the number of intensive care beds/ventilation places became scarce.
- Allegations that overreacted here is to be clearly countered: At doubling times of about 2.5 days, there would have been 8 times as many critical cases just one week later, and it would have been questionable whether the ventilation beds would still have been sufficient.
- Overall, the simulations show little room for easing the restrictions. It should be carefully considered for which social areas this space should be used.
- Reopening only 50% of kindergartens/primary schools would lead to a second wave of infection. However, this would be much "gentler" than the original dynamic, and could probably be cushioned if necessary, provided that appropriate observation (systematic testing) is made and there is a willingness to reintroduce restrictions if they become necessary. It would probably be better to avoid this wave altogether by flanking measures that go beyond the "only 50% opening".
- A moderate opening of some business would have a manageable effect.
- Comprehensive wearing of (fabric) masks makes a clearly noticeable contribution, but does not replace other measures.
- Contact tracing should be further evaluated.

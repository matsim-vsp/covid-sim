In this report, we address two current political developments; namely, the consideration of revisions of the German Infection Protection Act (IfSG) and two different vaccines for the upcoming fall and winter. We calculate policy effects against the background of a new hypothetical immune escape variant, which could occur in autumn. Our simulations show that the measures specified in the IfSG could be sufficient to push the R-value of this hypothetical new variant to a value below 1. Depending on the disease severity of the new variant and the level of population adherence to the measures, this may or may not be sufficient to keep the burden on hospitals from being greater than during the omicron wave in early 2022.

Regarding the two new vaccines, simulations confirm that which vaccine is more beneficial depends on the characteristics of a new viral variant.  In general, however, any vaccination in the fall/winter will help reduce hospital burden, especially among vulnerable/elderly populations.

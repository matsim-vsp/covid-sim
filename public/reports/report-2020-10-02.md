In the realm of schools, kindergartens, universities, workplaces, public transport, shopping, and leisure activities in fresh air, we believe that the contributions to the dynamics of infection can be reduced by appropriate measures to such an extent that they would no longer make a significant contribution to the overall dynamics of infection. Whether the measures are then applied in individual cases can be made dependent on the local situation.

For indoor activities, our simulations show that we should focus less on the absolute size of events and more on the density of people: indoor events with a high person density are problematic, regardless of their size. Instead of banning such events altogether, we recommend reducing their density, e.g. through appropriate stipulations or information campaigns.

An extension of the outdoor season for restaurants etc., e.g. by means of radiant heaters, makes sense from an epidemiological point of view.

The mathematical models confirm the non-linearity of the measures: As many measures as possible that perhaps are not perfectly enforced, help better than fewer measures that are perfectly enforced.

An effort to obtain better data would be helpful to better calibrate our models. We make suggestions in the full report.

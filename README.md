This repo contains the visualization website for MATSim/EpiSim, available at https://covid-sim.info. See that website for information on the use of MATSim for COVID-19 disease propagation, given various measures for combating its spread.

This README details build instructions for the website itself.

## Project pre-requisites

The site uses npm and yarn, and was developed using VS Code.

- You should install VS Code, npm, and yarn first.
- All code is TypeScript and shall remain so.

The following VS Code plugins are used:

- Prettier to force code style consistencey
- Vetur, for Vuejs support. This site is a [Vue](https://vuejs.org) SPA.
- Shader languages support

## Foundational technologies

You will need to know this tech in order to hack on this website:

- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) - typesafe JavaScript
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - the glue that connects UI elements to code. Similar to React but lightweight and awesome
- [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) - WebGL library for the fancy animations.
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org) - the template language used in Vue files. Pug uses Python-style indentation instead of open/close XML tags, which makes it far easier to read than bare HTML.

## First time install

One line fetches everything from the npm database:

```
yarn install
```

## Development Commands

### Compiling and hot-reloads during development

This command runs a local server with hot reload for testing, usually listens on http://localhost:8080

```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn build
```

### Run your unit tests

Well... I have not written tests but the infrastructure is there to use `jest`.

```
yarn test:unit
```

### Pushing to the live site

Travis-CI is configured to automatically build the site with **every push to master**, so don't push to master until you are ready for your code to go live.

- Travis config is in `.travis.yml`

## Project Layout

- `/src`: all TypeScript and Vue files go here
- `/src/assets`: images, .csvs, etc that get packaged by webpack
- `/src/components`: shared Vue components go here
- `/src/HomeIndex.vue`: the front page. Add new thumbnails for pages or other content here.
- `/src/runs`: Each page has its own folder under the `/src/runs` folder.
  - Connect up your new pages by adding a new folder here, and also adding a new URL to `/src/router.ts`. Anyone who knows the URL can then see the page. When you are ready for the public to also find it, add a link to `/src/components/TopBar.vue` and to the homepage.
  - Each run should use a `readme.md` file under `/src/assets` so that researchers can add notes without having to learn the build system.
- `/scripts`: Python scripts go here, which are used for preprocessing EpiSim results
- `/public`: large .zip files, project notes, etc go in public. These files are pushed as-is by webpack; i.e. they are not packaged in any way

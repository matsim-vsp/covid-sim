This class is used to produce the output files useful for analysis. One of the most important outputs created is <em>infections.txt</em>, which documents the infection state counts for each date and each county: e.g. number of individuals who are susceptible, infected but not contagious, contagious, seriously sick, recovered, quarantined, tested, vaccinated, etc. You may found a short description of the remaining standard outputs here:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>File name</strong></th><th><strong>File content</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>*.config.xml</td><td>The configuration options used to run the model</td></tr><tr><td>*.vaccinations.tsv</td><td>Number of vaccinations per vaccination supplier per day.</td></tr><tr><td>*.vaccinationsDetailed.tsv</td><td>Number of 1st/2nd/xth dosis per vaccination type (mRNA, vector, xbbupdate) per day.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a></sup></td></tr><tr><td>*.diseaseImport.tsv</td><td>Number of infections per strain being imported into the model area on each day.</td></tr><tr><td>*.strains.tsv</td><td>Number of new infections per strain per day.</td></tr><tr><td>*.infections.txt.csv</td><td>Number of agents (differentiated by vaccination status) per disease state per day; cumulative numbers are also given.

Mask usage describes the cutoff points for different types of masks. E.g. <em>{NONE=0.1, CLOTH=0.55, SURGICAL=1.0}</em> indicates do not wear a mask, 45% wear a cloth mask, and 45% wear a surgical mask.</td></tr><tr><td>*.outdoorFraction.tsv</td><td>Share of user-configured activity types that are performed outside per day. This depends on the daily temperature.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="visualization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#visualization"><span>Visualization</span></a></h2><p>Both infection dynamics and political discourse are in constant flux; for EpiSim to make an impact on decision-makers, the turnover must be rapid. Covid-Sim is a visualization tool that was developed to synthesize and plot the outputs of hundreds or thousands of simulations. The user simply uploads the output files to a server, and then can immediately visit a custom URL to see their results. The website is populated with an array of plots that show, e.g., incidence, hospitalizations, virus strains, and testing rates for a given scenario. Readers are encouraged to visit <a href="https://covid-sim.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://covid-sim.info</a> to view recent simulation results and read the corresponding reports. The code for covid-sim is open-source, allowing future users to recreate the system: <a href="https://github.com/matsim-vsp/covid-sim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/matsim-vsp/covid-sim</a>.

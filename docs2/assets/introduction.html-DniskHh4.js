The first version was programmed in about two weeks in April 2020 by Fachgebiet Verkehrssystemplanung und Verkehrstelematik (VSP)---english: the Department of Transport Systems Planning and Transport Telematics---at the Technische Universität Berlin (TUB). Starting with the examination of the effect of school closures in March 2020, the VSP team regularly submitted reports on the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to the German Ministry of Education and Research until February 2024 (<a href="https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/11125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MODUS-COVID consortium 2020-2024</a>).</p><p>EpiSim is well-situated to, in real time, address new outbreak situations and evaluate interventions due to its (1) data-driven and (2) agent-based nature. This allows the model to make up-to-date contributions to both the political and the scientific discourse.</p><ol><li><p>Many of the mechanics of EpiSim are directly fed by external data sources, including mobility, weather, mask-usage, and vaccination data. This means that the model can easily be kept current by updating the data sources.</p></li><li><p>The agent-based nature of EpiSim, as well as the mechanical infection model, allow non-pharmaceutical interventions to be modeled with relative ease. Furthermore, the interventions can be tuned to specific age-groups, or activity types.</p></li></ol><p>This user guide introduces the basic software structure of EpiSim, delineates what data is necessary to run a simulation, and what outputs are produced. This guide aims to introduce EpiSim to epidemiological modeling community such that EpiSim could be useful during future infectious disease outbreaks. Since EpiSim was created for COVID-19 and using the data available to our department, it won&#39;t be 1-to-1 applicable to other contexts; however, we hope that with some coding background, EpiSim can be reworked for a new epidemiological situation (the code is modular, meaning that classes can easily be replaced with alternate implementations). Or, future users can gut EpiSim, and use the components they need in their modeling framework. The following guide will focus on the general framework; we will use footnotes to comment on our department&#39;s implementations of certain functionalities.</p>',5)]))}const d=t(n,[["render",r]]),l=JSON.parse('{"path":"/docs2/introduction.html","title":"EpiSim - Introduction","lang":"de-DE","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1744454674000,"contributors":[{"name":"frievoe97","username":"frievoe97","email":"friedrich.voelkers@me.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/frievoe97"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"0d2d7def380184e6aedf2e4e3ee52ed7583f0a3c","time":1744454674000,"email":"friedrich.voelkers@me.com","author":"frievoe97","message":"upgrade vuepress 1 -&gt; 2"}]},"filePathRelative":"docs2/introduction.md"}');export{d as comp,l as data};

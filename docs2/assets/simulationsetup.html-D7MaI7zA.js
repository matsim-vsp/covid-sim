Doing this manually for each simulation would be work-intensive and prone to human-error. Thus, each study area has a separate class, a so-called &quot;production scenario,&quot; which sets all the regionally applicable input files and default configuration values. For instance, the school vacation periods are different for Berlin and Cologne (the class <code>SnzBerlinProductionScenario</code> is used for Berlin). The following subsection describes the input files that the production scenario reads before the simulation begins. Afterward, the data structure containing the configuration options---episim-config---is introduced, followed by the way in which activity reductions are configured.</p><h2 id="inputs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#inputs"><span>Inputs</span></a></h2><p>The essential input files for any EpiSim simulation are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Population Input:</strong> EpiSim has agents that move around the study area, and meet in facilities to complete activities (where there exists the chance of infection). Within the production scenario, a population file is imported that contains the demographic information for every individual simulated in EpiSim. In the standard Cologne model, this includes age, sex, and details of their home: longitude and latitude, facility ID, and county. The ability to integrate this demographic information into the simulation makes this ABM powerful; e.g., for age-prioritized vaccine distribution strategies, the age of an individual is read from the population file to determine eligibility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Facilities Input:</strong> Similarly, the facilities file enriches the model by providing information about each activity location: the longitude and latitude, as well as information about what activities can occur at that location.</p></li><li><p><strong>Events Files:</strong> Vital to EpiSim is the mobility behavior of individuals; this information is contained in so-called &quot;events&quot; files. The format of the events file follows the standard set by the MATSim output events files (see Figure 1 below for a depiction of an exemplary events file). Users can, however, create map mobility data from other sources (i.e. travel diaries). If an agent travels per public transit, the model knows when they got on and off the vehicle and the ID of that vehicle. When the agent conducts an activity, the activity type (e.g. home, leisure, work), the activity location, and the timeframe are accessible to the model. During the simulation, the contact model may use this information to detail all contacts between individuals, whether in a bus or in a university class. Within the events files, IDs of the corresponding agent, activity facility, or public transit vehicle are specified. These IDs can be matched to the population and facilities files, to extract pertinent information.<br> If the user specifies only a single events file, then it is assumed that the agent has the exact same daily plan for every day of the year. However, depending on the level of detail of the user&#39;s data, multiple events files may also be included<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a></sup>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="Example Image"></p><p><code>&lt;event time=&quot;8:00&quot; type=&quot;actend&quot; person=&quot;Lily&quot; facility=&quot;home\\_lily&quot; actType=&quot;home&quot;/&gt;}</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;8:10&quot; type=&quot;actend&quot; person=&quot;Sam&quot; facility=&quot;home\\_sam&quot; actType=&quot;home&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;8:15” type=&quot;PersonEntersVehicle&quot; person=&quot;Lily&quot; vehicle=&quot;Bus245&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;8:20” type=&quot;PersonEntersVehicle&quot; person=&quot;Sam&quot; vehicle=&quot;Bus245&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;8:45&quot; type=&quot;actend&quot; person=&quot;Toby&quot; facility=&quot;home\\_toby&quot; actType=&quot;home&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;8:50” type=&quot;PersonLeavesVehicle&quot; person=&quot;Lily&quot; vehicle=&quot;Bus245&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;9:00&quot; type=&quot;actstart&quot; person=&quot;Toby&quot; facility=&quot;schoolX&quot; actType=&quot;edu&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;9:00&quot; type=&quot;actstart&quot; person=&quot;Lily&quot; facility=&quot;schoolX&quot; actType=&quot;edu&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;9:10” type=&quot;PersonLeavesVehicle&quot; person=&quot;Sam&quot; vehicle=&quot;Bus245&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><code>&lt;event time=&quot;9:15&quot; type=&quot;actstart&quot; person=&quot;Sam&quot; facility=&quot;officeX&quot; actType=&quot;work&quot;/&gt;</code> <br><em><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Top: Example Trajectories of three agents (Toby, Lily, and Sam), in which agents spend time in the same spaces (in a bus, or in school, in this example).

In this report, we handle a scenario that is not expected but possible: a virus mutation that combines a level of immune escape regularly seen for the Omicron variants and heightened (but previously encountered) severity. This approximately matches Scenario 3--"rather unfavorable"--from our previous reports as well as (Berndt et al., 2022).

Going beyond the previous reports and (Berndt et al., 2022), we describe here (a) how an early-warning for such a scenario can be set up and (b) what measures would be required if this scenario occurs, and at what timeline they would need to implemented. We assume that if such a situation is detected, the measures described in Paragraph 28b of the German Infection Protection Act ("Infektionsschutzgesetzes" or IfSG) would first be exhausted (Stage 1). If then the hospitalization incidence surpasses 15 and is remains highly dynamic, then Stage 2 should be implemented to limit the strain on hospitals.

According to our simulation results, the combination of the following Stage 2 measures is successful:
1) Work: Implement a home-office rate of 50% and implement a indoor FFP2 mask mandate if multiple people share a workspace.
2) Public Leisure: reduce leisure activities in the public sphere (such as restaurant visits or public events) by 50%.
3) Private Leisure: reduce leisure activities in the private sphere (such as visits or private parties) by 50%.

To reflect the current political and societal mindset, educational institutions are not restricted more than what is specified in the IfSG. However, it is questionable whether above measure 3 can realistically be implemented. We would further need an FFP2 mask mandate in educational facilities and switch to a system where 50% of students attend classes remotely.

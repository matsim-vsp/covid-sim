We present a new data-based model that can explain a large part of the weekly changes in incidence solely based on the duration of outdoor activities and the maximum daily temperature. For this purpose, we consider the period from March 2020 to the end of 2020 in order to avoid the additional complexity caused by vaccinations and the Alpha variant after this period. Our final highly simplified model can account for approximately 65% of the change in incidence.

This model confirms the assumption that reducing contacts is crucial for containing the spread of infections. However, for political measures to be effective, we need to design measures—as well as communicate their necessity—in a manner that actually leads to changes in behavior among the population.

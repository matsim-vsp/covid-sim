Our model continues to predict an autumn wave. This is consistent with the increasing observed infection figures (see section 3).

Vaccination acts both by reducing the probability of severe courses of illness and by reducing transmission; mathematically, the two effects can even be completely separated. Booster vaccination acts on both components (see sections 4-6).

Based on our simulations, we examine the effect of different packages of measures and derive various recommendations. Among others, a booster vaccination campaign shows good effects on reducing infection when started early enough and implemented fast enough (cf. sections 7-8).

We analyze the different case-finding patterns in the federal states using cluster analysis. It can be shown that the assignment into different clusters is well explained by respective vaccination rates (cf. section 10).

In this report, we discuss the increasing time intervals between the COVID-19 waves and elaborate on the adjustments made to our MODUS-COVID model to replicate this trend. By slowing down the decline in immunity within the model, simulations reveal higher infection numbers in the autumn and winter of 2023/24 (compared to our earlier simulations). Additionally, a lower wave is projected in the subsequent spring. Based on our new model, we examine and simulate four scenarios for the winter of 2023/24 proposed by the Modeling Network for Severe Infectious Diseases (MONID). These scenarios involve varying degrees of immunity influenced by a vaccination campaign for individuals over 60 years old, as well as different levels of disease severity represented by the probability of hospitalization following an infection. Assuming a higher disease severity, our models indicate a strain on regular hospital units that could reach peak levels seen in previous pandemic phases.

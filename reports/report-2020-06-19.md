- **A breakdown of contact tracing must be avoided at all costs** if social activities are to be made possible. Sufficient resources must be made available for this purpose.

- **Opening up schools has a rather small effect compared to other openings.** We explicitly do not assume a different contagion dynamic for children, but the result is only based on the fact that, compared e.g. with activities of the leisure or work type, it mainly affects significantly fewer people.

- However, it can be assumed that **opening up schools would have other follow-up effects that would increase the infection dynamics,** such as increased participation of parents in work activities outside the home, and a signal effect in the sense of "the danger is over". At least in the case of the latter, one could perhaps take countermeasures by continuing to comply with distance and ventilation rules etc. wherever possible, i.e. especially at schools. Other experts can say more than we can about the implementation of these rules

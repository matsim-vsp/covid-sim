The mobility data show a slight but clear trend toward higher activity levels. We also show how the time spent away from home differs from the national average in different federal states. In rural regions, time spent away from home is generally higher than in urban areas because longer travel times are necessary (see section 2, p. 1).

In Berlin, the daily number of new infections has stabilized at a plateau. If current behavior is maintained, a drop in the number of infections can be expected in the near future due to immunity; especially through vaccinations, but also due to survived infections in combination with warmer temperatures. Our simulations confirm this (see Section 3, p. 3).

For this reason, we propose staged opening steps (cf. Section 4, p. 4 and Section 5, p. 5). After each opening step it should be ensured that the incidence rates continue to drop, and then the next step can be taken.

Our simulations show that in the present situation:

- first, quite wide-ranging partial openings are possible very soon in areas that make little contribution to the infection rates (e.g., cultural events with reduced numbers of people, mandatory masking and rapid testing, or alternatively vaccination);

- rapid opening steps are also possible in areas that contribute to infection incidence, as long as protective measures are maintained.

If incidences rise again, opening steps must be rolled back.

A long-term model shows how infection dynamics can approximate influenza dynamics over several years, with winter waves in each case (see Section 7, p. 8).

As a follow-up to the last report, we examine possible measures for the fall. The starting point here is that our model predicts rapidly rising infection dynamics for the fall under certain conditions, followed by rapidly rising hospital numbers. If such a case occurs, necessary countermeasures should be introduced promptly to prevent overloading of hospitals or the healthcare system. For this purpose, we particularly investigate measures based on different testing strategies, since these measures cause comparatively low restrictions or burdens on the population.

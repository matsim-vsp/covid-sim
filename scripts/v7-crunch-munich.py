# The latest *.infections.txt have one row per neighborhood instead of
# one row per day. Also there is an extra row for 'unknown' district,
# which needs to be clipped out.
#
# Use v7-crunch-berlin.sh bash script to run for each infections file.
#
# Usage: python crunch.py sz*.txt
# Outputs: one sz*.csv per input file
